# platform_issues
Users facing issues that need to be triaged.

This document will help us keep track of wishes, requests and issues (e.g. bug reports) from users via a varient of channels (e.g. support email, feedback at Open Targets hands-on workshops, etc).

This document is NOT an inventory of feedback gathered through usability testings of new or current aspects of the Platform. This is available elsewhere.
